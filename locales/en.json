    "about_text": "My interest in programming emerged in 2012, the year when I first encountered the internet. Together with my curious and inquisitive personality, this interest has grown exponentially until today and has become a part of my life. Both the presence of such a great interest in my life and the projects, in which I have been involved, have enabled me to gain a great deal of experience in this field.\n\nIn my first year of high school, I met robotics, which enables software to impact the world. In my school's robotics team, I learned not only to develop my imagination and creativity, but also to be a team member. I was very interested in design technologies such as CAD and CAM and contributed to the design of the robot. I was able to use these technologies and skills that I have brought to my life to create unique works with the CNC. I participated in FLL, FRC and VEX robotics competitions in my robotics adventure in the Team Imperium for 2 years and in the Luminous Robotics Team for 2 years, respectively.\n\nDuring these high school years, in addition to robotics, I also worked intensively on Mathematics. This field of science, which brings logic-based skills such as problem solving and critical thinking, both crucial for programming and robotics, has become a passion for me, both with the feeling of being able to solve complex problems in lessons and with my teachers noticing my ambitions and guiding me further. I participated in the Mathematics Olympics to keep these skills as up-to-date as possible, to test and improve them.\n\nAs someone who dreams of leaving a mark on the world, my biggest goal in my life is to make the world a better place through technology."
